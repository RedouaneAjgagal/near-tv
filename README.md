## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Order on mobile
- Bootstrap (navigation menu)
- Desktop & Mobile sections workflow

### Challenges i faced

- Hamburger menu: it's quit easy to just go and watch a tutorial on how to make a Hamburger menu using JS and follow the tutorial without knowing what you are doing. I didn't want do that because im about to start learning js anyways and its just not going to help when you dont even know the basic of JS so i decided to just use Bootstrap library and that was the only reason why i used bootstrap from the first place.

- Using css as my focus while Bootstrap is running the background: This was quit difficult trying to focus on css while bootstrap running on the background, like i mentioned above, my only purpose of using Bootstrap was because of Hamburger menu, but because of that i had to deal with alot of debugs because of Bootstrap css properties.

- Plans section: I had a hard time to figure how to make the middle plan above the others, and that was making the margin negative.

### Useful resources

- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) - Great website for stickers and icons, the good thing about it is free and the best part is the icons/stickers are transparent.

- [Colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/) - If you have troubles picking up colors then this is for you. I used Colorhunt for this project and here is the [Pallete](https://colorhunt.co/palette/371b584c35755b4b8a7858a6)

- [Favicon](https://www.favicon.cc/) - I use this website to make my Favicon very easy and simple.
